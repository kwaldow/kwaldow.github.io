**The Retail 4.0 project develops AR/VR solutions for the fashion industry to integrate retailers and end customers into the feedback process during the development of collections. The particular technical challenges include realistic rendering and accurate color reproduction of the garments on mobile VR/AR displays.**

Digital technologies are taking the fashion industry by storm and opening up new opportunities for retailers and end customers to influence collection development.

The aim of the Retail 4.0 research project is to develop a modular, scalable software solution that enables retailers to promptly pass on feedback on collection development to the manufacturer and directly involve the customer via a new, digital VR/AR shopping experience.

To achieve this goal, a VR/AR application with a cloud connection that also supports mobile devices is being developed on the basis of a 3D simulation and visualization solution currently in use. Innovative processes for communication between the retailer and the manufacturer are being designed and implemented for this purpose. Methods for efficient feedback from the end customer to the manufacturer are integrated in the event that the collection is available in the store. The end customer will also be able to use virtual products for communication in social networks. The solution is offered as a service to the retailer, who in turn makes it available to the end customer.

The prototype implementation of the solution takes place in the development center of the project's accompanying manufacturer with the involvement of selected retailers.

The Retail 4.0 solutions enable clothing retailers to have a significant influence on their future product range at an early stage of development and to provide customers with a unique shopping experience. In particular, the mechanisms for user-community interaction lead to the utilization of new creative potential, increased customer loyalty and thus significant competitive advantages.

The following aspects and technical challenges will be highlighted and examined in more detail as part of the project:

- Lifelike virtual prototypes of the garments
- New processes for real-time rendering of garments in 3D on mobile devices
- New methods for accurate color reproduction on mobile devices
- Identification of the right fit for the customer
- Discussion of colors, collection themes, material selection, cuts and collection elements with the help of annotations
- Interaction and collaboration between users
  Determination of customer behavior and preferences
