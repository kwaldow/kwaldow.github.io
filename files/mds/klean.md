**In order to overcome the challenges necessary for creating sign language avatars, a prototype software is to be developed as part of an MID innovation voucher that can be used to automatically clean up motion capture data.**

The KLEAN project enables facial expressions of a person signing to be recognised and transferred to blendshapes, a form of facial expression representation. These can be generated from various sources such as videos, webcam and screen recordings and saved as JSON files. Special facial expressions such as cheek puffing or tongue movements are recognised by various deep learning models. The system processes multiple videos at once and creates a logically combined animation file, which is further refined using classic filters and optimisation techniques. Personal profiles, based on calibration videos, allow the blendshapes to be customised. Neural filtering and the analysis of motion vectors further improve the data quality in order to transfer facial expressions as accurately as possible.
