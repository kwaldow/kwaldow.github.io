Joint project AVASAG - together for digital, barrier-free communication Sign language avatar.

There are around 70 million deaf people worldwide. For many of them, text language is a foreign language; they use sign language instead. In the "AVASAG" project supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), experts are working together to develop a 3D sign language avatar.

Digital communication is subject to rapid change. But is it taking everyone with it? There are around 70 million deaf people worldwide. For most of them, text language is a foreign language. Legislation has responded to the specific information needs of people with disabilities and obliges authorities and public bodies in Germany to provide barrier-free digital communication. Digital accessibility is becoming increasingly important in order to communicate content dynamically and correctly for all target groups. Automated tools help with barrier-free communication.

The project is creating a novel sign animation method for 3D avatars. It combines machine learning methods with rule-based synthesis methods that map text into gestures. The temporal and spatial dependencies of the gesture elements are resolved very precisely.

The aim of the joint project AVASAG (Avatar-based language assistant for automated sign language translation) will be a real-time controlled 3D sign language avatar for the automatic translation of German texts into sign language.
The aim is to enable digital and accessible communication through a qualitatively realistic representation of a 3D sign language avatar in order to offer added value for deaf people who can better participate in the digital society. AVASAG offers companies the opportunity to generate content automatically and dynamically and thus optimize interaction and communication on digital channels. A sign language avatar for automated translation in the field of travel information and service with a focus on transport and tourism is being implemented as a demonstrator.

Under the management of Charamel, the following researchers and developers from Germany will be working together for the next three years: yomma GmbH - experts for sign language in Hamburg; Ergosign GmbH, pioneer for user experience design in Saarbrücken; DFKI GmbH - Cognitive Assistance Systems and Language Technology (DFKI), in Saarbrücken, Cologne University of Applied Sciences / Institute for Media and Photo Technology, Cologne and the University of Augsburg / Human Centered Multimedia (HCM) in Augsburg.

The TH Köln is working on the sub-project "Automated recording of gestures using simultaneous recording of body, finger and facial movements" and will examine the following aspects and technical challenges in more detail as part of the project:

- Novel recording techniques using sensor fusion
- Implementation of suitable methods for mapping detailed facial expressions
- Implementation and evaluation of methods for synchronous recording of body and finger movements
- Creation of a comprehensive motion capture data set for the animation of a 3D sign language avatar
